Etude 4 Report

1. The furthest you can go into the desert without refuelling is 720km; 60*12 = 720, but in order to return safely this becomes 720/2 = 360.

2. To travel across the desert, we worked with increments of the safe distance of 360km, building up a supply, before moving to the next 360km increment.

3. To cross and return, greater amounts of fuel must be taken out further in order to support the buggy's return from the end of the desert.
	1. Fuel is taken out first to 370 km, where the buggy uses 20 of the 80 litres dropped to refuel and return to base. This is done 16 times.
	2. Afer refueling, the buggy departs to 370 km, uses 30 litres of the fuel there to refill, and continues on another 360 km. 80 litres of fuel are left here (of which 20 are used to refuel), and the buggy goes back to 370 km where it uses another 30 litres to refuel and return to base. This is done 8 times.
	3. The buggy follows the same pattern as step 2, but instead of turning back at 730 km (370 + 360) it continues on another 360 km to 1090 km. Here it deposits 80 litres of fuel, uses 20 to refill, and then returns to base with stops to refuel 30 litres each at 730 km and 370 km. This is done 4 times.
	4. The vehicle goes out to 1090 km following the procedure in step 4, but instead of turning back the buggy continues out 360 km to 1450 km, drops 80 litres of fuel and uses 20 to refill, then returns to bases with stops at 1090 km, 730 km, and 370 km to refill 30 litres at each. This is done twice.
	5. This pattern of continuing out an additional 360 km from the previous point and placing more fuel at every previous point along the way is continued until there is fuel at kilometres 370, 730, 1090, 1450, and 1810. Once all fuel prior to 1810 km has been replenished, the buggy goes out to 1810 km and has enough fuel to go out 603 km, reaching the end of the desert. Enough fuel is left at each of the previous points that, after returning the 603 km to 1810 km, the buggy can drive back and refuel every 360 km until it reaches the 370 km fuel cache. Here, it refuels and drives back the final 370 km, completeing the desert crossing and return.

4. In order to cross the desert, fuel must be dumped to make up the difference between maximum mileage and the end of the desert ((60+80)*12 = 1680, 2413 - 1680 = 733 km). 60 litres of fuel is taken to and dropped off at 240 km, then just enough is used to safely return the vehicle to base. The buggy is refueled and taken out to 240 km again, where 20 litres are added to the tank. The buggy continues forward another 240 km to 480 km, drops off 20 litres and continues another 240 km to 720 km, drops off 40 litres, continues a further 13 km and drops off 3.25 litres, picks up 2.1666 litres, and makes its way back to base by using 20 litres of fuel at 240 km. The buggy leaves one last time, picks up the remaining fuel at 240 km, continues to and refuels at 480 km, 720 km and 733 km. It then drives 720 km to and refuels at 1453 km and 2173 km, before a final refuel at 2173 km allows it to drive to 2413 km.

5. To cross and return with a more optimal amount of fuel, we used the following steps
	1. 320L of fuel is first dropped at 240km from the base in 4 trips.
	2. 20L of fuel is dropped and refueled with at 240km and a further 20L dropped at 480km from the base. The buggy then returns to the base.
	3. Stopping at 240km, refueling 20L, and continuing to 480km to drop 80L of fuel occurs twice.
	4. The buggy drives to 240km, refueling 20L. The buggy continues to 480km to drop 60L and refuel 20L. It continues to 720km and drops 20L before returning to 240km to refuel 20L and then returns to base.
	5. The buggy drives 240km forward and refuels 20L, drives a further 240km and refuels 20L, drives a further 240km and drops 80L, before driving 480km toward the base, refueling 20L and driving the final 240km back to base.
	6. The buggy drives in 240km increments, refueling with 20L each time until it reaches 720km from base where it drops 60L and refuels with 20L. The buggy then continues a further 240km to 960km where it drops 20L. The buggy then travels toward the base by 480km, before continuing in 240km/20L increments to base.
	7. The buggy drives forward in 240km/20L refueling increments until 960km where it drops 80L. The buggy then travels toward the base by 480km before continuing in 240km/20L refueling increments to base.
	8. The buggy drives forward in 240km/20L refueling increments until 1200km where it drops 80L. The buggy then travels toward the base by 480km before continuing in 240km/20L refueling increments to base.
	9. The buggy drives forward in 240km/20L refueling increments to 1440km where it drops 40L. It then continues to 1573km where it drops 24.3333L and refuels with 2.1666L. It then travels toward the base by 373km to 1200km. It then travels back to base in 20L/240km increments.
	10. The buggy drives forward in 240km/20L refueling increments to 1440km. It then continues to 1573km where it refuels with 11.0833L. It then travels forward 720km to 2293km, drops 60L and refuels with 60L, continues forward 120km to 2413km the end of the desert. It returns toward the base by 120km, drops 20L and refuels 20L, returns by 720km to reach 1573km where it refuels with the remaining 11.0833L of fuel. It then travels toward the base by 133km, followed by 20L/240km increments to finish at the base having used a total of 1824.3333L of fuel.
