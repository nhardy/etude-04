Etude 4 Report

1. The furthest you can go into the desert without refuelling is 720km; 60*12 = 720, but in order to return safely this becomes 720/2 = 360.

2. To travel across the desert, we worked with increments of the safe distance of 360km, building up a supply, before moving to the next 360km increment.

3. To cross and return, greater amounts of fuel must be taken out further in order to support the buggy's return from the end of the desert.
	1. Fuel is taken out first to 370 km, where the buggy uses 20 of the 80 litres dropped to refuel and return to base. This is done 16 times.
	2. Afer refueling, the buggy departs to 370 km, uses 30 litres of the fuel there to refill, and continues on another 360 km. 80 litres of fuel are left here (of which 20 are used to refuel), and the buggy goes back to 370 km where it uses another 30 litres to refuel and return to base. This is done 8 times.
	3. The buggy follows the same pattern as step 2, but instead of turning back at 730 km (370 + 360) it continues on another 360 km to 1090 km. Here it deposits 80 litres of fuel, uses 20 to refill, and then returns to base with stops to refuel 30 litres each at 730 km and 370 km. This is done 4 times.
	4. The vehicle goes out to 1090 km following the procedure in step 4, but instead of turning back the buggy continues out 360 km to 1450 km, drops 80 litres of fuel and uses 20 to refill, then returns to bases with stops at 1090 km, 730 km, and 370 km to refill 30 litres at each. This is done twice.
	5. This pattern of continuing out an additional 360 km from the previous point and placing more fuel at every previous point along the way is continued until there is fuel at kilometres 370, 730, 1090, 1450, and 1810. Once all fuel prior to 1810 km has been replenished, the buggy goes out to 1810 km and has enough fuel to go out 603 km, reaching the end of the desert. Enough fuel is left at each of the previous points that, after returning the 603 km to 1810 km, the buggy can drive back and refuel every 360 km until it reaches the 370 km fuel cache. Here, it refuels and drives back the final 370 km, completeing the desert crossing and return.

4. In order to cross the desert, fuel must be dumped to make up the difference between maximum mileage and the end of the desert ((60+80)*12 = 1680, 2413 - 1680 = 733 km). We found through trial and error that 240km increments seemed to work best, as well as leaving the remainder (13 km) to the second to last trip used the least amount of fuel. Our steps are outlined below:
	1. 60 litres of fuel is taken to and dropped off at 240 km, then just enough is used to safely return the vehicle to base.
	2. The buggy is refueled and taken out to 240 km again, where 20 litres are added to the tank. The buggy continues forward another 240 km to 480 km, drops off 20 litres and continues another 240 km to 720 km, drops off 40 litres, continues a further 13 km and drops off 3.25 litres, picks up 2.1666 litres, and makes its way back to base by using 20 litres of fuel at 240 km.
	3. The buggy leaves one last time, picks up the remaining fuel at 240 km, continues to and refuels at 480 km, 720 km and 733 km. It then drives 720 km to and refuels at 1453 km and 2173 km, before a final refuel at 2173 km allows it to drive to 2413 km having used a total of 363.25 litres of fuel.

5. To cross and return with a more optimal amount of fuel, we reasoned that for the final run toward the end of the desert, we should maximise the travel with full fuel capacity. This result in a final drop point of 1573km = (2413km - ((60L + 80L) * 12km/L) / 2). Through trial and error we found that 240km increments seemed to work best, leaving the final 133km remainder for the second to last trip into the desert as again, this seemed to used the least amount of fuel. Our steps are below:
	1. Starting from the base, refuel the tank with 40L and pick up 80L in cans. Drive away from the base for 240km. Drop 80L of fuel in cans at the current location. Drive toward the base for 240km.
